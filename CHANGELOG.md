## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- `client.notifications.list()` / `read(id)` / `read_all()` — the bell in the
  web app's header: the caller's own rows, newest first, with the unread count;
  mark one read (`NotFoundError` for an id that is not the caller's) or all.
- `client.announcements.list()` — the operator's banner, active rows only,
  most severe first.
- `client.entitlements.get()` — what the caller's org may do: the plan, its
  allowance and caps, and, for a downgraded org, `writes_blocked` with
  `read_only_reason`. Any member may read it; complements `app_models()`'s
  per-model `included`.
- `client.conversations.report(id, kind, *, message_id=None, note=None)` —
  file a report on a conversation or one of its messages; `kind` is `unsafe`
  or `unhelpful`, and the answer (`FiledReport`) carries the report's `id`.
- Typed models for all of the above: `Notification`, `NotificationList`,
  `NotificationsReadAll`, `Announcement`, `AnnouncementList`, `Entitlements`
  with its `EntitlementLimits`, `FiledReport`, and the `REPORT_KINDS`
  vocabulary.
- CI on every push and pull request (lint and test); the publish workflow
  stays tag-only.
